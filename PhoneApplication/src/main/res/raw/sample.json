        "rendered": "\n<p>Usually, we know celebrities only by the job for which they became &#8220;celebrities&#8221; and we think they know nothing more than that and are completely unaware of the world of science and technology. But some of the celebrities invested in technology to force us to step back from this idea. However, the number of tech lover celebrities is much lower than the number of celebrities who have preferred to invest their money in the fashion, food, and beauty industry. Let&#8217;s see which celebrities are tech lovers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Jessica Alba<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/uc?export=view&amp;id=13-w9bi5MUc8l375owPLIu1D9f-bSUaHg \" alt=\"Jessica Alba Oscar\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>You might know Jessica Alba for her starring roles in &#8220;Idle Hands&#8221; and &#8220;Sin City&#8221;, but there is another side to her. Did you also know that she is a pretty successful tech entrepreneur?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She helped co-found <a href=\"https:\/\/www.honest.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"The Honest Company (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">The Honest Company<\/a> back in 2012. This e-commerce company flogs baby care products, shampoos, conditioners, makeup, and household cleaners to millions of customers all around the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Founder Jessica Alba was inspired by the 2008 birth of her first child, Honor, and her own history of childhood illnesses to create a company that provided an alternative to the prevalent baby products with ingredients such as petrochemicals and synthetic fragrances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alba founded the company with Brian Lee. It recently also raised around $75 million during its Series E of public funding. She started with some 17 things, and now the website has ballooned.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Jared Leto<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/uc?export=view&amp;id=1frRLEFKxFQBT9eR9QwvM6EaYRy22tg8T \" alt=\"Jared Leto\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Jared Leto, an actor, singer-songwriter, and director, has backed electronic signature service DocuSign and mindfulness app Headspace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, he\u2019s invested in Silicon Valley company, Zenefits, Surf Air, Wish and Nest.

But there is a deeper relationship that emphasizes on the better world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2011, he started Downey Ventures to become an angel investor in tech-related start-ups and consumer entertainment companies. He is also the dude who wants to save the world with the help of artificial intelligence and robotics. He was quick to add that he doesn\u2019t know it all, but is willing to do what it takes to make the world a better place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Will.i.am<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/uc?export=view&amp;id=14jKkyEBbT75D3OpaLdDMrzeaIsAplHwh \" alt=\"Will.i.am\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Will.i.am, otherwise known as William Adam is probably best known for his role in The Black Eyed Peas. He made a foray into the tech world after he attended and performed at a FIRST robotics competition at the Southern New Hampshire University.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He founded his tech company i.am+ in 2012 as an e-commerce business but it has since pivoted into becoming a profitable B2B tech startup. It specializes in creating AI-powered chatbots to help provide customer services for their many diverse clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company has been able to raise $117 million of which $89 million was collected in a recent round of public funding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Ashton Kutcher<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/uc?export=view&amp;id=1mKFXi-5BTp_zRp27i2VLfIcKG-1B-gJr \" alt=\"Ashton Kutcher\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>We should consider Ashton Kutcher a technology investment giant. The actor has famously invested in many tech companies \u2014 51 investments to be exact \u2014 in companies like Spotify, AirBnb, Foursquare, Uber, Bebo, Box, and Dwolla. On top of that thick portfolio, Kutcher is avn entrepreneur \u2014 he founded a media company called Katalyst that curates media events for entertainment and tech; it has hosted speakers like Ben Horowitz, Steve Forbes, and Arianna Huffington.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Will Smith<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/uc?export=view&amp;id=1E0ddOmrX5wz2ZOiLWzP5XhVTzxo6c2pG \" alt=\"Will Smith\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Will Smith partnered up with Japanese soccer star Keisuke Honda to launch Dreamers VC.

She owned one-fifth of a tech startup company\u2019s equity, called Backplane; and the rest was invested by heavy hitters like Google CEO Eric Schmidt, Menlo Ventures, and SV Angel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Backplane, a social network that lets you make your own cash as a user, did a nosedive after there was a lot of mismanagement, and the product never rolled out. Backplane eventually renamed itself to place.xyz, and Gaga\u2019s current involvement is unclear.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was also named the creative director of Polaroid in 2010 \u2013 and was key in developing Zink, the zero-ink printer, camera glasses, and the GL30 Instant Camera. However, this association ended in 2014. In 2011, she also visited Google\u2019s campus in California, and took part in a live interview moderated by Google Moderator \u2013 and that in itself was pretty high-tech.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of what has been said about Lady Gaga&#8217;s economic performance, the movie star of &#8220;a star is born&#8221;, launched her beauty line, <a href=\"https:\/\/abanabsalan.com\/2020\/10\/11\/featured\/which-celebrities-have-their-own-beauty-cosmetics-line\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Haus Lab (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Haus Lab<\/a> on September 2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Justin Bieber<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/uc?export=view&amp;id=1FZD0NcEuP1lrtuH_UddAfLNAGhK_oeZ3 \" alt=\"Justin Bieber\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Justin Bieber, the Canadian singer, and songwriter has put money into music streaming service Spotify, chat website Tinychat, and selfie app Shots.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The singer\u2019s manager Scott Braun told Forbes in 2012 that Bieber\u2019s investment portfolio was between 2% and 5% of the singer&#8217;s net worth.
